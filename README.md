_Statistical analysis for rats._

A common translation of the word "krysa" is "a rat", mostly considered a lower
creature, but in fact a really cute and intelligent little rodent.

The idea behind KrySA is to make statistical software available even for the
"rats" - people who can't or don't want to buy a commercial tool for statistics
for whatever reason. KrySA is a free, open-source tool that anyone can afford!

KrySA is written in [Python 3.5](https://python.org) and higher using
[Kivy](https://kivy.org) framework together with
[packages](http://badida.sk/krysa/gettingstarted.html). To run it you have to
have all of them installed.

You can find more about KrySA, source documentation and screenshots
[here](http://badida.sk/krysa).
